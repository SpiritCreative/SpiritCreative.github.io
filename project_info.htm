            <h1>Project Information</h1>
			
            <p style="margin: 0px 0px -20px 0px;">
			<b>This page of the NextBridge web site will provide you with access to key information as the project unfolds.</b>
			</p>
			<p style="margin: -30px 0px -20px 0px;">
			<h2> Project Details: </h2> 
			</p>
			<p style="margin: -50px 0px -20px 0px;">
				The Project will consist of the installation of a double-circuit 230 kilovolt (kV) transmission line generally paralleling the existing double-circuit 230 kV transmission corridor (the existing East-West Tie) connecting the Wawa Transformer Station (TS) to the Lakehead TS near Thunder Bay. The Reference Route primarily parallels the existing East-West Tie and is approximately 400 km long. Alternative Routes, which do not parallel the existing East-West Tie, have been identified to avoid certain sensitive features crossed by the existing line and could result in a line that is up to 430 km long. The proposed right-of-way for the Project is expected to be approximately 52 m to 56 m in width however additional space may be required where there are angles in the route, for crossings of the existing East-West Tie right-of-way (or other high voltage lines in the area), for general construction access, for temporary working space and laydown areas, access roads, and where the landscape requires additional lands for access (i.e., in areas with steep slopes or other challenging terrain).
			</p>

			<h2 id="OPA">Ontario Power Authority and Ontario Energy Board Correspondence Regarding Project Schedule</h2>
			<p style="margin: -15px 0px -20px 0px;">
				The Ontario Power Authority (OPA), the provincial agency responsible for long-term electricity planning in Ontario, has been monitoring the factors supporting the need for the new East-West Tie Project.  On September 30, 2014, NextBridge received a copy of a letter sent from the OPA to the Ontario Energy Board (OEB).  In that letter, the OPA proposed that the development schedule for the Project be extended to work toward a 2020 in-service date.  On October 29, 2014, the OEB recommended that NextBridge and the OPA work together to produce a revised development schedule for the Project.  The revised schedule may include flexibility to allow the Project to come into service quickly should the pace of demand growth change and require an in-service date prior to 2020.  NextBridge is currently working with the OPA to develop a revised development schedule.
			</p>

				The September 30, 2014 OPA letter to the OEB can be viewed <a href="http://www.rds.ontarioenergyboard.ca/webdrawer/webdrawer.dll/webdrawer/rec/451101/view/OPA%20-%20EWT%20Development%20Schedule%202014%2009%2030.PDF" target="_blank">here.</a>

			<h2>Pukaskwa National Park:</h2>
			<p style="margin: -15px 0px -20px 0px;">
			To date, NextBridge has not studied a route through Pukaskwa National Park based on direction from Parks Canada in February 2014.  On July 9, 2014 the Ontario Minister of Energy wrote to the Federal Minister of the Environment requesting that the federal government reconsider its position and allow NextBridge to assess routing options in the Park. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin: -30px 0px -20px 0px;">
			NextBridge recognizes that there may be additional features to consider in assessing a potential route through Pukaskwa National Park.  If authorization is given to study a route through the Park, NextBridge will consider enhancing the current consultation and engagement program with Park-specific engagement initiatives.  In any event, NextBridge will continue with our commitment to timely and meaningful dialogue with the Provincial and Federal governments, First Nations and MÃ©tis groups and interested stakeholders to develop a robust Project.
			</p>
			<h2>The Environmental Assessment Process:</h2>
			<p style="margin: -15px 0px -20px 0px;">
			The first step in the environmental assessment process is the preparation of a Terms of Reference. The Terms of Reference outlines the work plan NextBridge will follow to address the requirements of the Environmental Assessment Act. The Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change approved the Terms of Reference for the project on August 28, 2014. The approved Terms of Reference provides the framework for the second step in the process, the preparation of the Environmental Assessment (EA) document.
			</p>
			<p style="margin: -30px 0px -20px 0px;">
			The EA process for the Project has commenced. During the EA, NextBridge will conduct environmental studies, and meet with agencies, community representatives, First Nations and M&eacute;tis communities, and members of the public to determine the potential positive and negative impacts of the Project on the people, places, businesses, economy and natural environment in the study area. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin: -30px 0px -20px 0px;">
			Members of the community, public, landowners, stakeholder groups, government agencies, and other interested persons are encouraged to participate in the planning process. 
			</p>
			
			
			<h2 id="TOR">Approved Terms of Reference:</h2>
			<p style="margin: -15px 0px -20px 0px;">
